# LS47 hand-computable cipher
Je to mírně 
Jedná se o mírné zlepšení šifry ElsieFour popsané Alanem
Kaminsky

This is a slight improvement of the ElsieFour cipher as described by Alan
Kaminsky [1]. We use 7x7 characters instead of original (barely fitting) 6x6,
to be able to encrypt some structured information. We also describe a simple
key-expansion algorithm, because remembering passwords is popular. Similar
security considerations as with ElsieFour hold.

There's also a 3D-printable SCAD model of the whole thing. Yay!

We suggest printing the model using more than one filament color to make the
letters easily recognizable. Thanks go to Martin Ptasek for providing the
picture.

If you trust your computer, there is now a very simple python implementation in
`ls47.py`. A much better version usuable as an actual binary (also supporting
several versions of padding and the original ElsieFour cipher) was supplied by
Bernhard Esslinger from the CrypTool project, available in `lc4.py`.

### Character board

We have added some real punctuation, basic stuff for writing expressions,
punctuation and quotes. The letters of the board now look like this:

```
_ a b c d e f
g h i j k l m
n o p q r s t
u v w x y z .
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 , - + *
/ : ? ! ' ( )
```

Zoomed in, it's very practical to have extra position information written on
the tiles:

```
/-----\  /-----\  /-----\  /-----\  /-----\
|     |  |     |  |     |  |     |  |     |
| _  0|  | a  1|  | b  2|  | c  3|  | d  4|  ...
|   0 |  |   0 |  |   0 |  |   0 |  |   0 |
\-----/  \-----/  \-----/  \-----/  \-----/

/-----\  /-----\
|     |  |     |
| g  0|  | h  1|  ...
|   1 |  |   1 |
\-----/  \-----/
   .        .
   .        .
   .        .
```

To run (hand-run) the encryption/decryption, you will also need some kind of a
marker (e.g. a small shiny stone, bolt nut or similar kind of well-shaped
trash).

## How-To

You may as well see the paper [1], there are also pictures. This is somewhat more concentrated:

### Šifrování
1. Najdeme vstupní písmeno: pozice nešifrované kostičky + offset na pozici markeru = pozice zašifrovaného písmena
2. Řádek s nezašifrovaným písmenem rotujeme o 1 doprava
3. Sloupec se zašifrovaným písmenem o 1 dolů
4. Žnačku (Marker) posuneme o offset na kostičce se zašifrovaným písmenem

#### Encryption example with ascii images!

```
1,2. Symmetric key with         3,4. We want to encrypt 'y'.
     marker put on 'e'               Look at the marked tile:

  [e]f _ a b c d                     /-----\
   l m g h i j k                     |     |
   ( ) / : ? ! '                     | e  5|
   s t n o p q r                     |   0 |
   z . u v w x y                     \-----/
   5 6 0 1 2 3 4
   + * 7 8 9 , -

5. Ciphertext is 'w'            6. Rotate the plaintext 1 position
   (='y' moved by (5,0))           right, keep marker coordinates.

                               [e]f _ a b c d        [e]f _ a b c d
   Output 'w'!                  l m g h i j k         l m g h i j k
                                ( ) / : ? ! '         ( ) / : ? ! '
                                s t n o p q r         s t n o p q r
                                  z . u v w x y  >>   y z . u v w x
                                5 6 0 1 2 3 4         5 6 0 1 2 3 4
                                + * 7 8 9 , -         + * 7 8 9 , -


7. Rotate the ciphertext 1         Now look at the ciphertext tile:
   position down.

   [e]f _ a b , d                       /-----\
    l m g h i c k                       |     |
    ( ) / : ? j '                       | w  2|
    s t n o p ! r                       |   3 |
    y z . u v q x                       \-----/
    5 6 0 1 2 w 4
    + * 7 8 9 3 -

8. Update the marker position         9. GOTO 3.
   by ciphertext offset (2,3).


    e f _ a b , d
    l m g h i c k
    ( ) / : ? j '
    s t[n]o p ! r
    y z . u v q x
    5 6 0 1 2 w 4
    + * 7 8 9 3 -


```

### Dešifrování
Proces dešifrování je podobný:
1. Najdeme zašifrované vstupní písmeno: pozice kostičky (mínus) – offset na pozici markeru = pozice dešifrovaného písmena
2. Řádek s rozluštěným písmenem rotujeme o 1 doprava
3. Sloupec s nerozluštěným písmenem o 1 dolů
4. Značku (Marker) posuneme o offset na kostičce se nerozluštěným písmenem


### Key generation

Grab a bag full of tiles and randomly draw them one by one. Key is the 49-item permutation of them.

### Key expansion from a password

Remembering 49-position random permutation that includes weird characters is
not very handy. You can instead derive the keys from an arbitrary string of
sufficient length.

"Sufficient" means "provides enough entropy". Full keys store around 208 bits
of entropy. To reach that, your password should have:

- at least around 61 decimal digits if made only from random decimal digits
- at least around 44 letters if made only from completely random letters
- at least around 40 alphanumeric characters if made randomly only from them

To have the "standard" 128 bits of entropy, the numbers reduce to roughly 39,
28 and 25, respectively.

Note that you can save the expanded tile board for later if you don't want to
expand the passwords before each encryption/decryption.

The actual expansion can be as simple as this:

1. initialize `I:=0`, put the tiles on the board sorted by their numbers (i.e. as on the picture above)
2. Take the first letter of the password and see the numbers on its tile; mark them `Px, Py`.
3. Rotate `I`-th row `Px` positions right
4. Rotate `I`th column `Py` positions down
5. `I := I + 1 mod 7`, repeat from 2 with next letter of the password.
6. Resulting tile positions are the expanded key

### Undistinguishable ciphertexts

To get a different ciphertext even if the same plaintext is encrypted
repeatedly; prepend it with a nonce. A nonce is a completely random sequence of
letters of a pre-negotiated length (e.g. N tiles drawn randomly from a bag,
adviseable value of N is at least 10).

You may also want to add a random number of spaces to the end of the ciphertext
-- it prevents the enemy from seeing the difference between ciphertexts of 'yes
please' and 'no', which would otherwise encrypt to gibberish that is easily
distinguishable by length, like `qwc3w_cs'(` and `+v`.

### Authenticated encryption

Because ciphertext may be altered in the transfer or during the error-prone
human processing, it is advised to append a simple "signature" to the end of
the message; which may look as simple as `__YourHonorableNameHere`. If the
signature doesn't match expectations (which happens with overwhelming
probability if there was any error in the process), either try again to see if
you didn't make a mistake, or discard the message and ask the sender to
re-transmit.

This works because the cipher output is message-dependent: Having a wrong bit
somewhere in the middle causes avalanche effect and erases any meaning from the
text after several characters.
